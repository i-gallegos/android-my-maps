## Notes

This app had a lot of moving parts, so it was hard for me to keep track of how
each component and file interacted with each other. I attempted changing the
marker, but had some issues figuring out how to implement the custom marker
drawable.  I instead decided to focus on changing the appearance of the app and
adding the count of locations per map.  This also allowed me to learn about
custom string spans.
